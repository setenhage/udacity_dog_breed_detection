# udacity_dog_breed_detection

This is the repository for the final project of the Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree from Udacity. The aim of this project is to create an application that takes dog images as input and outputs the predicted dog breed. In the application, it is also possible to input a human face, after which the application returns the dog breed that has the closest resemblance with the human face.
